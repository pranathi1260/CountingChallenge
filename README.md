# CountingChallenge

## Project Overview
This project implements object counting and segmentation using two distinct approaches:
1. **Classical Computer Vision (Non-AI)**: Utilizing OpenCV for contour detection, thresholding, and morphological operations.
2. **Deep Learning (AI)**: Utilizing YOLOv8 for robust instance segmentation and counting.

Both methods aim to achieve high accuracy in counting objects within images and providing visual masks.
